<h1>FAQ fix the error “Plugin “react” was conflicted between “package.json » eslint-config-react-app»”</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>When you create a new project using Create React App, a file called package.json is created with several options in it. One of those options is to enable plugins for various code editors. You get the notification and need to <a href="https://ittutoria.net/error-plugin-react-was-conflicted-between-package-json-eslint-config-react-app/">fix the error “Plugin “react” was conflicted between “package.json » eslint-config-react-app»”</a></p>
<p>These plugins provide additional functionality such as automatic lintering when editing or compiling.</p>
<h2>Why do I get an error when I try to save my file?</h2>
<p>This could be due to several reasons. First, if you are using ES6 features such as class properties or imports then this could come in conflict with Node dependencies. Feel free to disable these features until you upgrade your node dependencies.</p>
<p>You can also read about how to fix this issue. You will need to go into your project folder and edit the package.json file. Make sure you have valid licenses for any third-party components that you use.</p>
<h2>What is the use of the “Plugin”?</h2>
<p>The plugin allows your app to communicate with the config file, in this way you can load default values using ES6 modules through the import/export keywords.</p>
<p>This Plugin uses webpack to process all sorts of files including JSON</p>
<p>The only required field for it is name which refers to the type of JavaScript module that will be processed.</p>
<h2>How to fix the error?</h2>
<p>This is what I call an unexpected error. The purpose of this markup is to configure or run your plug-in. Occasionally, something goes wrong when that code is written results in an incorrect or nonsensical result.</p>
<p>This has been called a syntax error or parse error. In order to prevent such errors from occurring, you should always make sure that all coding related to your plug-in includes any necessary comments as well as full stops between each line of code.</p>
<p>Also, often times some of the codings contains reference to other scripts or stylesheets, which may not exist anymore due to redirects or previous deletions. It's important to identify these issues early on to save time fixing them later.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between “Package.Json” and “Eslint-Config-React-App”?</h2>
<p>If you are using Create React App, there’s a pretty good chance you aren’t running from npm install anymore.</p>
<p>Well, besides being able to identify yourself more easily, it’s also helping save tons of data by moving away from installing everything digitally to downloading libraries (which take less space).</p>
<p>These libraries can be either privately owned ones or officially distributed versions.</p>
<p>The unique thing about them is that they provide patches until release date while the officially released version has no bugs. This way you get feedback from users preventing your bug from releasing itself.</p>
